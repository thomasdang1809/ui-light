                <p>
                Working as an UI/UX designer, I have created many products about design for customers in Norway, UK, Singapore and Japan. With a long time working in companies, I have learned many things from projects, customers and other colleagues.  I like working in a professional environment and team work. I really like sharing my knowledge with other members in team, so I have trained many members in team to build a strong team in the company.
